      <h1>Provisional Birth and Death Data</h1>
      <p>The Health Department collects data on every birth and death that happens in New York City. These data, called vital statistics, provide a fundamental understanding of birth trends, death trends, and population health in New York City.</p>
      <p>The data on this page are <strong>provisional data</strong>, which means that the numbers may change as the Health Department continues to process the data. Publishing provisional data allows the Health Department to release data faster, while it undergoes additional processing like quality review and finalization. <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/vital-statistics-data.page">Final data are published in the Annual Summary of Vital Statistics</a>.  <a href="">Final data are also available online at EpiQuery</a>.</p>

          Data on births by maternal age group are shown above. Numbers are presented in the form of counts. Counts tell you how many births are happening in different groups or categories, but they do not take into account how many people exist in those groups or categories overall, like a rate does. Fluctuations in counts do not necessarily indicate a meaningful trend.

Counts tell you how many births are happening in different groups or categories, but they do not take into account how many people exist in those groups or categories overall, like a rate does. For example, birth counts may be highest among Brooklyn residents, but the birth rate may be highest in the Bronx, due to the population size.

      <p>Data on deaths come from death certificates. The Health Department tracks information about all deaths that occur in New York City, even among people who are not residents of NYC.

        Data on infant mortality overall are shown above. Infant mortality rates are calculated as number of infant deaths (less than 1 year of age) per 1,000 live births. Due to the small number of infant deaths, rates are prone to fluctuations and may not show trends.

      <h2 class="spacer">Additional Resources</h2>
      <p>All data here are provisional, which means that they are not finalized and are subject to change. Data on births and deaths can take months or years to be finalized as additional details are reported, deaths are investigated by the Office of Chief Medical Examiner, and results from autopsy or toxicology results are completed. Once data for a given year are complete, Health Department staff spend time processing and analyzing the data. Typically, data are finalized about two years after the end of a reporting year.</p>
        
      <p>These provisional data are being released to provide more timely information on births and deaths in NYC. When using or disseminating these data, we recommend flagging them as provisional and subject to change.</p>
