      <h1>Provisional Birth and Death Data</h1>
      <p>The Health Department collects data on every birth and death that happens in New York City. These data, called Vital Statistics, provide a fundamental understanding of birth trends, death trends, and population health in New York City.</p>
      <p>The data on this page are <strong>provisional data</strong>, which means that the numbers here might change as the Health Department continues to process the data. Publishing provisional data allows the Health Department to release data faster, while it undergoes additional processing like review, cleaning, and finalization. <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-sets/vital-statistics-data.page">Final data are published in the Annual Summary of Vital Statistics</a>.  <a href="">Final data are also available online atEpiquery</a>.</p>

      <p>All data here are provisional, which means that they are not finalized and are subject to change. Data on births and deaths can take months or years to be finalized as additional details are reported, deaths are investigated by the Office of Chief Medical Examiner, and results from autopsy or toxicology results are completed. Once data are finalized, Health Department staff spend time processing and analyzing the data. Typically, data are finalized about two years after the end of a reporting year.</p>
        
      <p>These provisional data are released to provide more timely information on births and deaths in NYC. When using or disseminating these data, we recommend flagging them as provisional and subject to change.</p>
